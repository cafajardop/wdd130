        Hello! My name is Carlos AndrÃ©s Fajardo and I am from BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
        I enjoy cycling, going to the gym, and spending time with my family. I
        am currently studying Development and I am excited to keep learning more
        about technology and creativity. I look forward to building my own
        projects and discovering what the future holds for me.

        BogotÃ¡ is Colombia's sprawling high-altitude capital. La Candelaria, its
        cobblestone center, features colonial sites such as the neoclassical
        Teatro ColÃ³n and the 17th-century Iglesia de San Francisco. It's also
        home to popular museums, including the Museo Botero, which displays art
        by Fernando Botero, and the Museo del Oro, featuring pre-Columbian gold
        artifacts.
